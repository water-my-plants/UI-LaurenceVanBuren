Water My Plants allows users to track and monitor the watering schedules for their plants. The landing page was built using JavaScript, HTML and CSS (LESS). The app was built using React and Node/Express and deployed to Heroku. 

The marketing/landing page gives an overview of the app and how it works. Users can choose to sign up or log in and are then taken to the application. Inside the app, the user can add plants and give them a name, location and optional description. When the plant has been added to the list, the user can add or change the watering schedule for that plant. For each plant on the user's list, the user will receive text message and in-app notifications when it's time for a particular plant to be watered.
